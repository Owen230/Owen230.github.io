                <p id="img1p">On 17th October I met this girl named Sarah when i went to watch a film for a friend's birthday. Altough we barely spoke that day we slowly began to speak to each other on messenger. Shes the first girl that I ever spoke to regularly on the internet and for that I already am grateful cause someone is giving me a chance to be heard. We developed a friendship on the sole reason that both our hair were soft and she couldn't manage to mess it up. I began to see how amazing she was and decided to create this just to show how much she means to me and how amazing she is. </p>

                <p id="img2p">She's the light in my darkness the ignition to my heart. Shes been a distraction a type of hault from sadness and depression. Everytime I see her she brings a smile to my face. There's something about her, shes different from other girls. Superman will never save her, spiderman will never catch her and the flash will never run to her like I would. I'll try to be there for her but I know that I won't ever manage to help her as much as she has helped me.  </p>

                <p id="img3p">The worst part of when I meet her is when I have her in my hand and then I had to say goodbye. They say that you miss people the most after you lose them altough this is through missing someone makes you remember them more so just having her in my mind is enough if i'm not seeing her.  </p>

                <p id="img4p">Some people talk about having a lucky charm in their life I talk about having her in my life to give me confidence. Shes my world shes my yin and im her yang. Shes my everything and I'm her nothing.  I'm out of words to describe how fortune I am to have her in my life but I hope you get the point.</p>
